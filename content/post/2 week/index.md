## Overview

1. A few weeks ago I finally moved to a new place. 

2. 6 days ago my mither flew to me and we have a lot of fun. I finally started to eat properly...:D 

3. On Tuesday, in physical education, in total, I defended about 2 and half minutes in the plank, I think this is a good result. 

4. It became very warm outside and i started walking more often.
