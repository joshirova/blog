## Overview

1. A few days ago i went shopping with my mom, eye aesthehics haha ;D

2. I walked a lot and breathed freah air.

3. This week there was productive physical education, I ran 100 meters, the result in time was 13.27. The result is not bad, since i was involved in athletics 6 years ago.

4. On Thursday, i defended my lab work in C++. I got the maximum score and i'm very happy :)
