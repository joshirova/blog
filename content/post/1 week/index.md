## Overview

1. Few days ago i completely moved to a new home. It was very difficult, but i'm satisfied. 

2. On Tuesday, i wrote a test on integrals. Unforgettable feeling when you see examples that you can hardly solve. 

3. On Tuesday there was also physical education, where i did a great job. I ran about 12 laps of 200 meters, did warm-up ans strength exercises. 

4. March 8, Women's day, i bought a bracelet.
