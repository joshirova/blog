## Overview

1. ***Project presentation plan***

**Plan your presentation ahead of time. Don't forget the required sections:**

    - Title page (first slide);
    - Introduction;
    - The main part of the presentation (usually contains several subsections);
    - Conclusion.
   
The body of the presentation is the most important.

When creating it, imagine that people who are poorly familiar with the topic of the report will listen to you. They need to understand what your report is about and what your role is in what you are describing.

2. ***Design presentation***

Style the text and titles of different slides in the same style.

If you choose blue for the headings and the font "Cambria", the headings on all slides must be blue and Cambria. We chose the font “Calibri” for the main text, we will have to use it on all slides.

Quotations and notes can be highlighted in a different font and color (but there should not be too many of them).

Do not get carried away with excessive selection of bold, italic and colored text.

3. ***Presentation Background Color***

Make sure that the text does not merge with the background, keep in mind that the contrast on the projector will be less than on your monitor.

The best background is white (or close to it), and the best text color is black (or a very dark shade of your choice).

4. ***Designing the title (first) slide***

From the contents of the first slide it should be clear what it is about, to whom it refers, who is the author. To do this, do not forget to specify:

    - Organization (educational institution, enterprise, etc.);
    - Topic of the report (title);
    - Surname, name and patronymic of the speaker (in full);
    - Your supervisor (if the work is done under someone else's supervision);
    - Contact details (e-mail, website address, phone).

5. *** Font size in the presentation ***

The font size for the slide title should be at least 24, and preferably 32 and above.

**Always include the title of the slide (of each slide in the presentation). A distracted listener should understand at any moment what your report is about now!**

It is better to choose a font size for body text from 24 to 28 (depending on the selected font type).

Less important material (additions and notes) can be arranged in font from 20 to 24.

Keep in mind that the screen you'll be showing your presentation on will likely be quite far away from the audience. The presentation will look smaller than what is on your screen at the time of creation.

Move 2-3 meters away from the computer screen and try to read the text in the presentation. If the slides are difficult to read, increase the font size. If the text does not fit on one slide, break it into 2, 3 or more slides (the main thing is that the presentation is easy to view).

6. ***Images in presentation***

Try to find suitable images (photos, graphs, diagrams, etc.)

Remember that the presentation should be visual, and images greatly enhance visibility. Just do not overdo it, images should be replaced by text =)

7. ***Final slide***

Many people think that you can stop at the conclusion.

But there is a simple move that will evoke positive emotions in the audience: make the last slide thank you for your attention!

It seems to be a trifle, but it works quite effectively

8. ***Conclusion***

So, today you learned seven simple rules with which you can correctly design any presentation.

And one more tip for those who read articles to the end:

     **Remember that the presentation should be interesting and visual, do not tire the listener with monotonous text or an overabundance of bright colors. Make a small holiday for 5-10 minutes.**
