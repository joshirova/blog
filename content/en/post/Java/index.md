# Java

Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (later acquired by Oracle). The official release date is May 23, 1995.

Java programs are translated into bytecode, which is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JVM is a program that processes byte code and passes instructions to the hardware as an interpreter. The advantage of such an implementation is the independence of the bytecode from the operating system and hardware, which allows you to run Java applications on any device for which a JVM exists.

Another important feature of Java technology is a flexible security system due to the fact that the execution of the program is completely controlled by the virtual machine. Any operation that exceeds the program's set permissions (such as attempting unauthorized access to data or connecting to another computer) causes an immediate abort.

Often, the disadvantages of the concept of a virtual machine include the fact that the execution of bytecode by a virtual machine can reduce the performance of programs and algorithms implemented in the Java language. Programs written in Java have a reputation for being slower and taking up more RAM than those written in C. However, when compared to the interpreted languages that are most commonly used in web development, Java's performance is usually noticeably better.

# Java development

In web development, Java occupies the Enterprise segment: typically, web services and applications are implemented in Java by Customers from very large businesses, often for historical reasons or due to the presence of a qualified internal team.

  The speed and convenience of developing web applications in Java leaves much to be desired (as well as the cost of such development), but in terms of reliability and performance of the final result, Java does not lag behind other compiled languages and is ahead of interpreted ones.

In Android development, Java is now being supplanted by Kotlin, which also runs on top of the JVM. The goal of creating the Kotlin language is to be more concise and type safe than Java, and easier to use than Scala.
