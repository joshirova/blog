## Overview

# A little about Markdown

Markdown, or markdown, is a markup language for text documents. It allows you to create texts without using Word and other editors. The markup can be read and rendered on any system or browser.

Markdown was created by writer and blogger John Gruber along with web activist Aaron Schwartz. They wanted to come up with the simplest and most convenient markup language with which text can be translated into a beautifully designed look. At the same time, the text must remain readable even without being reduced to a ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù look. This is what Markdown turned out to be. It was created in 2004, but the language has gained the most popularity now. It is supported by a variety of blogging platforms, note-taking services, CMS, and even instant messengers. Therefore, markdown is useful for everyone who deals with the web, from developers to bloggers.

# How to use the markup language?

A person writes text in any editor and adds special combinations of standard characters to it. This is the markup, it shows where the text should be bold, where the heading should be, and where the list should be. Symbols can be used to mark up headings, text highlights, and even complex structures like tables. Special converters form a finished document based on the markup. It's similar to using HTML, but the markdown is simpler and the text is more readable. Converters are either pre-installed in a text editor, such as a note-taking app, or are downloaded separately.

# Who uses Markdown?


- Internet users who communicate in instant messengers and write notes in services that support markup.
    
- Developers who write documentation for projects using markdown - they need a simple and reliable tool.

- Content managers when filling sites that support markdown. The markup can also be used on web pages.

- Bloggers who write longreads when they design materials for articles. Many writing platforms support markdown, such as Notion.

- Writers and copywriters who want a simple text styling tool - markup readable on any device.

- Enthusiasts who use markup for personal purposes: write notes and to-do lists, keep diaries or create flashcards.

# What is Markdown for?


- Quickly format an article to translate to PDF or just look nice with no extra effort.
    
- Layout of a text document for placement on the site, but without the use of HTML.
    
- Writing documentation for the code.
    
- Making notes in a personal digital notebook.
    
- Writing beautiful messages in messengers.

# Markup rules

Basic syntax. It is very simple: the text is "wrapped" in characters or they are placed before the line. This is how the headers will look like.

# Heading H1 (first level, for example the title of the text)

## Heading H2 (second level headings)

### Heading H3 (third level, intermediate subheadings)

And so on, up to the sixth-level headings with six hashes in front of the line. In practice, subheadings below H3 are practically not used.

In markdown, you can apply basic text formatting. You can‚Äôt insert a capital letter or handwritten font, but it‚Äôs easy to highlight important areas.

*Italics* or _italics_

**Bold text** or __bold text__

***Bold and underlined text***

> Quote (an angle bracket is placed before each line of the quote)

- Bulleted list item

1. First item of a numbered list

2. The second item of the numbered list (and so on)

Inserting materials. The markup allows you to insert different elements into the text: links and images, which are then ‚Äúpulled up‚Äù into the document when formatting is applied.

[link_text](any link) to insert links

[image caption](link to image) to insert images into text

***, - or ___ - a horizontal line on the entire line that separates part of the text from another

And if the text should contain an asterisk or any other ‚Äúspecial‚Äù character that can be read wrong, you must put a backslash in front of it. For example, like this: *. Then the character will be displayed in the text as it should and is not considered as a markup rule.

Extended syntax. There is an extended version of markdown. It's called GFM, GitHub Flavored Markdown. It has other interesting features, such as ~~strikethrough text~~ wrapped in two tildes, or a `short code snippet`. A multi-line block of code wraps in three gravis above the top line and below the bottom line. Like this:

"`

There will be a line of code here.

And here too.

"`

You can create tables based on vertical and horizontal bar characters. Or "to-do lists":

- [X] Completed Deed

‚Äî [ ] Backlog

If the editor supports GFM, then all such syntax elements will also be converted and will look like on a web page. It even has emojis: you just need to insert the code of the desired emoticon wrapped in colons into the text. Something like this: :smile:. Codes
